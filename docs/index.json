The ultimate goal is to pursue desired performance metrics and generate the best possible design. Much of this progress is made by gradient-based algorithms, which are promising methods to efficiently search the enormous degrees of freedom in high-dimensional design space.  However, existing local-gradient-based optimization approaches lack nonlocal exploration ability required for escaping from local minima in non-convex landscapes. In this work, we propose a nonlocal optimization method with novel directional Gaussian smoothing (DGS) operator to address this challenge. Compared with the local gradient, the DGS gradient allows for a large smoothing radius to capture the global structure of loss landscapes. A deterministic Gauss-Hermite quadrature is used to develop a DGS gradient estimator with higher accuracy than Monte Carlo estimators. The nonlocal optimization method has its advantages on portability and flexibility to naturally incorporate the parameterization, physics simulation (e.g., FEM, CFD, MD, DFT), and objective formulation together to builds up an effective inverse design workflow. The methodology is demonstrated by structural topology optimization problems and nanophotonic device design examples.  Our method shows superior performance with faster convergence compared with classical local gradient approaches in structural and materials design..","tags":[],"title":"A Nonlocal Optimization Method for Inverse Design Problem","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"My paper \u0026ldquo;Imprecise global sensitivity analysis using Bayesian multimodel inference and importance sampling\u0026rdquo; has just been published in Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing.

Practically, the system inputs are often assumed to be mutually independent or correlated by a multivariate Gaussian distribution. However, this subjective assumption may introduce bias in the response estimate if the real dependence structure deviates from this assumption. In this work, we overcome this limitation by introducing a flexible copula dependence model to capture complex dependencies. A hierarchical Bayesian multimodel approach is proposed to quantify uncertainty in dependence model-form and model parameters that result from small data sets. This approach begins by identifying, through Bayesian multimodel inference, a set of candidate marginal models and their corresponding model probabilities, and then estimating the uncertainty in the copula-based dependence structure, which is conditional on the marginals and their parameters. The overall uncertainties integrating marginals and copulas are probabilistically represented by an ensemble of multivariate candidate densities. A novel importance sampling reweighting approach is proposed to efficiently propagate the overall uncertainties through a computational model. Through an example studying the influence of constituent properties on the out-of-plane properties of transversely isotropic E-glass fiber composites, we show that the composite property with copula-based dependence model converges to the true estimate as data set size increases, while an independence or arbitrary Gaussian correlation assumption leads to a biased estimate.\n","date":1593561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593561600,"objectID":"b776e442d7111a207951248bb2d38c00","permalink":"https://jxzhangjhu.github.io/post/ijar-paper/","publishdate":"2020-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/ijar-paper/","section":"post","summary":"My paper \u0026ldquo;On the quantification and efficient propagation of imprecise probabilities with copula dependence\u0026rdquo; has just been published in International Journal of Approximate Reasoning.

To understand these properties, it's necessary to characterize the chemical ordering and identify order-disorder transitions through efficient simulation and modeling of thermodynamics. In this study, a robust data-driven framework based on Bayesian approaches is proposed for the accurate and efficient prediction of configurational energy of high entropy alloys. The recently proposed effective pair interaction (EPI) model with ensemble sampling is used to map the configuration and its corresponding energy. Given limited data calculated by first-principles calculations, Bayesian regularized regression not only offers an accurate and stable prediction but also effectively quantifies the uncertainties associated with EPI parameters. Compared with the arbitrary truncation of model complexity, we further conduct a physical feature selection to identify the truncation of coordination shells in EPI model using Bayesian information criterion. The results achieve efficient and robust performance in predicting the configurational energy, particularly given small data. The developed methodology is applied to study a series of refractory HEAs, i.e. NbMoTaW, NbMoTaWV and NbMoTaWTi where it is demonstrated how dataset size affects the confidence when data is sparse.","tags":null,"title":"Robust data-driven approach for predicting the configurational energy of high entropy alloys","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kuo Tian","Jiaxin Zhang","Xiangtao
