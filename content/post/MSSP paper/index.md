My paper "Imprecise global sensitivity analysis using Bayesian multimodel inference and importance sampling" has just been published in *Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing*. A shared link with 50-days free access is provided:

A few highlights of this work:

* A fully probabilistic multimodel approach for imprecise GSA is proposed.

* This approach employs Bayesian multimodel inference to quantify uncertainties in model inputs.

* The multimodel inference is combined with an importance reweighting scheme for estimation of imprecise Sobol indices.

* The methodology can be used to assess confidence in computed sensitivity indices and inform testing and data collection efforts.
