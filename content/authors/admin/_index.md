Jiaxin Zhang is a Staff Scientist in Computer Science and Mathematics Division at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). Dr. Zhang is a computational data-driven researcher with a Civil and Mechanical engineering background in uncertainty quantification, machine learning, large-scale data analytics and design optimization.

His research strives to fulfill that improvement of analyzing and designing complex, uncertain engineering systems, by developing a computationally efficient and unified design-under-uncertainty framework that can provide useful insight and coverage at an acceptable cost.
