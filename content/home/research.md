### Accelerated Inverse Learning with Invertible Neural Networks
We propose a novel approach leveraging recent advances in deep invertible models incorporated with a precise localization via gradient descent for efficiently and accurately solving inverse problems and apply to advanced materials design and discovery.

### A Scalable Directional Gaussian Smoothing (DGS) for Blackbox Optimization
We develop a nonlocal gradient operator, Directional Gaussian smoothing (DGS), to skip small local optima and capture major structures of the lossâ€™s landscape in black-box optimization, specifically high-dimensional cases (e.g., scale to 2000D). Please see our arxiv: https://lnkd.in/eC2dS-v

We have successfully applied DGS for a couple of scientific applications, including advanced materials design, structural optimization, heat conduction model calibration in additive manufacturing. Please check our Materials & Design paper https://lnkd.in/ePypMVt

###  Benchmarking graph neural networks for materials chemistry
We present a workflow and testing platform, MatDeepLearn[Github repository](https://github.com/vxfung/MatDeepLearn), for quickly and reproducibly assessing and comparing GNNs and other machine learning models, and we use this platform to optimize and evaluate a selection of top performing GNNs on several representative datasets in computational materials chemistry.
